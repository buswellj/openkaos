Build Script Archive
---------------------

From OpenKaOS 4.0.0-beta1 the build-script archive stores snapshots of release build scripts.
This enables users to rebuild past releases from the current github code.

The old archives for opensrc-lists are stored in archive/opensrc-lists/

The new archives are stored in archive/builds/<release>/

For example:

 archive/builds/4.0/4.0.0-beta1/

This contains the entire tree for past build release scripts. Running the build in here will spin a past build.
